# Future

Here are some of the ideas for what I would like my vim configuration to include.

### What to include

- I would like to be able to do my own snippets for vue.
- I'd like to have better control over LSP's, using Mason and configuring the formatters etc is unintuitive.
- Add terminal plugin that can be hidden and found easy.
